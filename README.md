The source code for the local network simulator is in the "Local Network Simulator" folder.

In the "Testing for WC program" folder, it contains the code that I have changed for wc program and also some testing outputs by running the Lancet debugging tool. The outputs have been zipped into a zip file.

The code I have written for GREP program is in an EC2 machine, which has been closed by Bowen a few months ago. After a long time searching, Bowen told me that we might have lost the code. I will try to recover the code and post it here.
