The source code for the local network simulator is in the "Local Network Simulator" folder.

In the "Testing for WC program" folder, it contains the code that I have changed for wc program and also some testing outputs by running the Lancet debugging tool. The outputs have been zipped into a zip file.

In the "Testing for GREP program" folder, it contains the changed code, which needs to be used in the Lancet debugging tool testing. What I have changed from the source code can be checked in the diff file in that folder.
